# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    Whatever frustration I felt while trying to solve the problems, specifically the hobbit one, was completely overwhelmed and overshadowed by the pure hype and joy I felt for finding a solution.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    Going pretty good, I found most my answers after taking a break and remained focused throughout the process.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
    There's nothing I can think of that I don't already have. I've got a quiet place and wonderful teammates.
